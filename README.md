# Introduction to AI-Assisted Development: Django To-Do App

This project is a simple To-Do application built using the Django web framework as part of a homework assignment for the AI Dev Tools Zoomcamp hosted by the DataTalksClub.

The primary goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how modern AI tools (such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) can accelerate and guide the application development process, even if you are unfamiliar with the underlying technologies like Python or Django.

## App Demo

## Features

The application supports standard To-Do list functionality:

- **Create** new tasks with descriptions.
- **Edit** and **Delete** existing tasks.
- **Assign** due dates to tasks.
- **Mark** tasks as resolved/completed.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you will need:

- **Python:** The core programming language used by Django.
- **`uv` (optional but recommended):** A modern, fast Python package manager and virtual environment creator. If you prefer `pip` and `venv`, those will work too.

## Getting Started

These instructions assume you are using `uv`. If you are using standard Python tools, the commands will be slightly different (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` instead of `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`).

### 1. Clone the repository

````bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_folder_name>

2. Set up the environment and install dependencies

```bash
uv env create
uv activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### 3. Apply database migrations

```bash
uv python manage.py migrate
```

### 4. Run the development server

```bash
uv python manage.py runserver
```

### 5. Access the application

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the To-Do application.
